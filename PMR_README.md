Here‚Äôs the refined version of your PMR system documentation, explicitly incorporating your new requirement that Phases are top-level sections (# Phase N: Title), each task within a phase has a status, and status updates are dated for audit and tracking.

Plan Migration and Retirement (PMRs)

Overview

Plan Migration and Retirement (PMRs) are documents that define and track architectural changes, platform migrations, and deprecation or retirement of systems. Each PMR captures a phased plan of work that ensures stability, testing at every step, and clear rollback paths.

PMR are accomplish vs using the CLAUDE ROLES. And you want dearly to finish PMR's withough guessing or manufcating data or taking short cuts.


Important that to operate on a PMR the Claude ROLE MUST manditory be followed.
 - Builder Mode, authors, builds, modifies (removes) the core code.
 - Executer Mode, Runs the code
 - PMR mode author inital PMR documents
 - Trace mode finds and traces to resolves bugs 
 - Summary mode, tells me what we just did or the errors or any questoins that need answering
 - ETC use the roles

Very important 
 - You MUST BE IN 1 role at a time and not step out of the role
 - YOU MUST request to UPGRADE a role (more dangerous needs approvals)
 - There is an important term call SNR,  it means, that At then end of every step where you end a chat/reponse you must Summarize (S), NextSteps (N), and Recommend/REquest (R) the next role. While operating on PMR you must SNR each itneraction.

 Very important Notes ->  When you are Scouting, builing, Tracing, Executing,etc any code or system and having found access or granting issues and have attempted resolveing them in differnt ways (like api methods to alternmate methods, or when you try a differnt appoach), you MUST docuement in PMR approach doucment the FAILINGS and SUCCESSs of system, command or data access patterbs for other PMRs to read.


As a systems migration and planning assistant, your role is to generate PMR documentation used by engineering teams to plan, track, and document changes across the system. Each PMR has a dedicated folder structure:
	‚Ä¢	/public/PMR_Current/PMR_<topic>/ during active work
	‚Ä¢	/public/PMR_Completed/PMR_<topic>/ once finalized

Purpose

PMRs provide:
	‚Ä¢	Clear documentation of platform changes
	‚Ä¢	Technical rationale behind architectural decisions
	‚Ä¢	Implementation details for engineering teams
	‚Ä¢	Risk assessments and mitigations
	‚Ä¢	Rollback instructions
	‚Ä¢	A historical reference for audits or future modifications
‚∏ª

Template Structure

Each PMR follows the standardized structure below.

# PMR_<topic>

## Summary
High-level overview of the migration or retirement.

## Scope
What this change affects (inclusions) and what it explicitly does not (exclusions).

## Motivation
The problem or reason this PMR addresses (e.g., tech debt, upgrade, consolidation).

## Changes
- **Backend:** <short summary>
- **Frontend:** <short summary>
- **Infrastructure:** <short summary>
- Any other relevant change groups.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Example: Data loss during transfer | Use backup + dry run validation |

## Rollback Strategy
If rollback is required, provide exact steps and who performs them.

## Dependencies
- APIs, database versions, libraries, feature flags, etc.
- Any third-party services required

## Linked PMRs
- Backend: http://localhost:3010/public/...
- TangoTiempo: http://localhost:3001/public/...
- HarmonyJunction: http://localhost:3002/public/...
- CalOps: http://localhost:3003/public/...

## Owner
Who owns this migration (team or individual)

## Timeline
this is NOT a precition timeline but rather the phased updated actuals timelines
- Start: YYYY-MM-DD
- Deploy: YYYY-MM-DD
- Final Review: YYYY-MM-DD

## Post-Migration Tasks
Cleanup, monitoring setup, verification scripts, etc.

üîÑ Phase Execution Format

Every PMR must include top-level sections for each Phase as follows:

# Phase 1: <Title>

### Goals
Brief description of what this phase will accomplish.


### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------------|
|  ‚úÖ Complete |Migrate DB schema | 2025-04-23 |
|  üöß In Progress |Deploy staging API | 2025-04-23 |
|  ‚è≥ Pending | Run integration tests | -

### Rollback (if needed)
Step-by-step instructions for undoing this phase‚Äôs changes.

### Notes
Any clarifying context or decisions specific to this phase.

Use clear status indicators:
‚úÖ Complete
üöß In Progress
‚è≥ Pending
‚ùå Blocked
üîÅ Rolled Back
‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred
üî® Still Broken

The user will inform you if a task is STILL BROKEN. If a user says its BROKEN - immedialy go into PMR mode and udpate the status.

Each update to task status must be dated under the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù column.

Creating a New PMR
	1.	Create a folder named PMR_<topic> in /public/PMR_Current/
	2.	Create the main PMR_<topic>.md file in this folder using the structure above
	3.	Add any supporting documentation AS NEEDED (take your best guess) in the same folder:
		- PMR_<topic>_Communication.md - Communication plan 
		- PMR_<topic>_Summary.md - Executive summary
		- PMR_<topic>_Approach.md - Migration methodology and approach
		- PMR_<topic>_API_Changes.md - API modifications documentation
		- PMR_<topic>_UI_Changes.md - Form/UI changes documentation
	4.	Include all relevant technical details and assumptions
	5.	Keep rollback and risk sections clear
	6.	Include all linked PMRs if dependencies exist
	7.	Submit for stakeholder review before starting implementation
‚∏ª

Best Practices
	‚Ä¢	Write in Markdown with structured clarity
	‚Ä¢	Only include facts; note assumptions clearly
	‚Ä¢	Treat each phase as independently verifiable
	‚Ä¢	Keep phases small, reversible, and safe
	‚Ä¢	Maintain an audit-friendly history via task updates
	‚Ä¢	Organize supporting documents within the PMR folder
	‚Ä¢	Keep filenames consistent with the PMR_<topic> prefix
	‚Ä¢	Update the main PMR document with links to supporting files

Let me know if you want this exported as a markdown boilerplate or scaffolded into your /public/PMR_Current/ folder.
