There are men dancing with men, women dancing with women, and mixed gendered couples. Typically the music is played in Tandas, and there are Cortinas. The rules of the Milonga are applied: a.) Followers must wait to be asked. b.) Leads typically ask for dances using cabeceo, chateseo, siteseo, walkbyeseo, yelleseo, grabeseo, and Followers indicate via Mirada that they’re interested. 3.) The line of dance is sort of observed. 4.) Tandas/Cortinas vs. Continuous Music. Sometimes, depending on the Practica, an area in the middle is designated as a dedicated Practica Area, and there are one or two outer tracks to simulate a dancing environment.",

      "title": "Short Sequences – enrich your vocabulary with 52 sequences every year",
      "description": "<div class=\"xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs\">Learn a new, short, easy-to-remember sequence every week. That’s 52 sequences a year. Your vocabulary will be enriched, and your partners – super impressed.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\"><strong>Open level</strong><br class=\"html-br\" />Open-level class means anyone above the Beginner level can attend. However, the class is not catered towards the ‘easy’ though it is meant to be for everyone. You will be challenged no matter your level. It’s a typical combination class, adding proven and well-structured combinations to your repertoire, so keep coming, and one day you will know it all.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\"><strong>New sequence</strong><br class=\"html-br\" />A new sequence is introduced every week so no worries about not being able to catch up. Of course, you are missing out every time you miss the week, but no risk of not being able to follow what is being introduced. If you have a practice partner, bring her/him with you so you are both on the same page.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\"><strong>Technique Insights</strong><br class=\"html-br\" />The connection, correct lead and follow, directions of movement, and proper technique are always explained. However, if the movement is absolutely new to you, the explanations might not be sufficient or understandable. This is absolutely normal.</div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\">Challenge yourself into listening and trying to understand based on what you already know. Try to find similarities and logic in every movement. This way, you are truly learning and not just being taught.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\"><strong>Immediate Application</strong></div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\">Guided Practica Chiquita follows the class immediately so that what you’ve just learned can be immediately implemented into your dance and practiced with practica attendees. If you forgot the steps, then lead the timing – your instructor is present, and you can ask additional questions.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\"><strong>Level of difficulty</strong><br class=\"html-br\" />In this class, elements from any level can be added to the combination as long as the sequence is short enough to be danced within one or two phrases. It is a good way to familiarize yourself with aspects of tango that are yet unknown to you. To start – mimic what you see. You will learn the technique during regular classes. You can also ask your instructor or higher-level students during Practica.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s\"><strong>Inspiration</strong><br class=\"html-br\" />Sometimes we don’t even know what we don’t know, and we need to be shown what can be done with the elements we have already learned in classes and how they can be combined into beautiful, nicely flowing sequences.</div>",

There are men dancing with men, women dancing with women, and mixed gendered couples. Typically the music is played in Tandas, and there are Cortinas. The rules of the Milonga are applied: a.) Followers must wait to be asked. b.) Leads typically ask for dances using cabeceo, chateseo, siteseo, walkbyeseo, yelleseo, grabeseo, and Followers indicate via Mirada that they’re interested. 3.) The line of dance is sort of observed. 4.) Tandas/Cortinas vs. Continuous Music. Sometimes, depending on the Practica, an area in the middle is designated as a dedicated Practica Area, and there are one or two outer tracks to simulate a dancing environment.",
