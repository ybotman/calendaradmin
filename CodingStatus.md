## Recent Changes

### User Deletion Enhancement
Updated the `handleDeleteUser` function in `/src/app/dashboard/users/page.js` to:
- Check if the user is linked to an organizer
- Display a clear warning about the impact on the linked organizer
- Before deleting the user, update the linked organizer to remove user references
- This prevents orphaned references in the database

### Organizer Deletion Enhancement
Updated the DELETE handler in `/src/app/api/organizers/[id]/route.js` to:
- Fetch the organizer details to get user connection information
- Update the linked user to remove organizer references
- Consider removing the RegionalOrganizer role from the user
- Only then proceed with deleting the organizer
- This maintains data integrity and prevents orphaned references

### User-Organizer Connection Handling
Enhanced the PATCH handler in `/src/app/api/organizers/[id]/route.js` to:
- Detect when a user disconnection is requested (firebaseUserId set to null)
- Detect when a user connection is requested (new firebaseUserId value)
- Use the dedicated connect-user endpoint for establishing connections
- Update the user's references when disconnecting
- This ensures proper bidirectional updates

## Next Steps
1. Prevent temporary user creation in the "Create Org" process
2. Add organizer type checkboxes to the user management interface
3. Improve the UI to clearly show the current user-organizer relationship
4. Add a user dropdown to the organizer edit form for connecting existing users
5. Make the user field mandatory when the active flag is set on organizers
