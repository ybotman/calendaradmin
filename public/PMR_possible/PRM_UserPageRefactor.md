# PMR_UserPageRefactor

## Summary
This PMR outlines a comprehensive refactoring of the Users page in the CalOps administration application. The current implementation is a monolithic component of over 1,300 lines that combines UI rendering, data fetching, state management, and business logic in a single file. This refactoring will separate these concerns, improve code organization, enhance maintainability, and establish patterns for similar refactoring efforts throughout the application.

## Scope
### Inclusions
- Complete restructuring of the UsersPage.js component architecture
- Extraction of presentation components for reusability
- Creation of custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Implementation of improved error handling and data loading patterns
- Optimization of role mapping and filtering logic
- Enhancement of user management operations with proper separation of concerns
- Documentation of the new architecture and component relationships

### Exclusions
- Changes to the backend API endpoints
- Functional changes to user management features
- Authentication system modifications
- Major UI redesign (focus is on code structure, not visual changes)
- Database schema changes

## Motivation
The current Users page implementation exhibits several issues that reduce maintainability and increase development complexity:

1. **Code Size**: At 1,300+ lines, the component is difficult to understand and navigate
2. **Mixed Concerns**: UI rendering, data fetching, and business logic are tightly coupled
3. **Repetitive Code**: Similar UI structures are duplicated across tab panels
4. **Complex State Management**: Managing form state, filtering, and API interactions in one component
5. **Challenging Error Handling**: Error handling scattered throughout the component
6. **Difficult Testing**: The monolithic structure makes unit testing nearly impossible
7. **Debugging Challenges**: Finding issues requires searching through hundreds of lines of code

This refactoring will address these issues by implementing modern React patterns and best practices.

## Changes
- **Component Structure**: Split the monolithic component into smaller, focused components
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract data fetching and state management logic into reusable hooks
- **Service Layer**: Move API interactions to a dedicated service layer
- **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling patterns
- **Form Management**: Extract form handling logic into specialized components
- **Documentation**: Add thorough documentation for the new architecture

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking existing functionality | Comprehensive test plan with exact feature parity validation |
| Introducing performance regressions | Performance benchmarking before and after changes |
| Extended development time | Phased implementation with incremental improvements |
| Missing edge cases in current implementation | Code review and pair programming during refactoring |
| Increased complexity from splitting code | Clear documentation and consistent patterns across components |

## Rollback Strategy
1. Maintain the original component during development
2. Implement feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations
3. Test both implementations side by side
4. Use Git revert operations if issues are found after merge

## Dependencies
- React 18+ functionality
- MUI components (v5+)
- Existing API client libraries
- Role and user data schemas

## Timeline
- Start: 2025-04-25
- Estimated Completion: 2025-05-15
- Final Review: 2025-05-20

## Post-Migration Tasks
- Add comprehensive unit tests for extracted components
- Document new architecture in the engineering wiki
- Create examples of the new patterns for other developers
- Monitor error rates in production after deployment
- Review performance metrics

# Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

### Goals
Thoroughly analyze the current implementation and plan the component structure.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Document current component structure and dependencies | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Identify logical boundaries for component extraction | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Create component hierarchy diagram | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Define interface contracts between components | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Document state management requirements | - |

### Rollback (if needed)
No changes to production code in this phase.

### Notes
Focus on maintaining all current functionality while establishing clear component boundaries. Document the specific responsibilities of each proposed component.

# Phase 2: Extract Reusable UI Components

### Goals
Extract UI components that can be reused across the application.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Extract TabPanel component | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Create UserTable component with DataGrid integration | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Extract UserSearchBar component | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Create StatusDisplay component for user status indicators | - |
| ⏳ Pending | Extract dialog components (AddUserDialog, EditUserDialog) | - |

### Rollback (if needed)
Keep all original components and conditionally render based on feature flags.

### Notes
Ensure each extracted component has proper PropTypes, documentation, and basic tests.

# Phase 3: Implement Custom Hooks for Data Management

### Goals
Move business logic and data fetching into custom hooks.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |

# Phase 4: Refactor Role Mapping and Processing Logic

### Goals
Improve the complex role mapping and processing logic.
