# Calendar Admin Authentication Log

This file maintains a record of authentication events in the Calendar Admin application.

## Authentication System Overview

The Calendar Admin app uses a simple password-based authentication system:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User enters password on login page
   - Password is hashed client-side using SHA-256
   - Hash is compared with stored hash in auth.json
   - On success, an auth_token cookie is set
   - Middleware checks this cookie on protected routes

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Password is never stored in plaintext
   - SHA-256 hashing is used for password verification
   - HTTP-only cookies prevent client-side access
   - HTTPS (in production) ensures secure transmission
   - Simple but effective for initial deployment

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - Implement proper user management system
   - Add username/email login capabilities
   - Use proper authentication service (Firebase Auth, Auth0, etc.)
   - Add multi-factor authentication
   - Implement role-based access control
