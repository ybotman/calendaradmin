# Issue: BTC Import Limited Events

## Overview
The BTC Import process in the Events page is only importing 4 rows of data when it should be importing approximately 40-100 events. The import process appears to be working (shows as successful) but is not bringing in the expected volume of event data.

## Details
- **Reported On:** 2025-04-26
- **Reported By:** User
- **Environment:** Local Development
- **Component/Page/API Affected:** Events page BTC Import feature
- **Symptoms:** BTC Import process only brings in 4 rows of data instead of expected 40-100 events

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Events page
2. Initiate the BTC Import process
3. Wait for the import to complete successfully
4. Observe that only approximately 4 rows are imported instead of 40-100

## Investigation
- **Initial Trace:** Need to examine import logs and API responses
- **Suspected Cause:** Possible filtering issue, API limitation, or data processing bottleneck
- **Files to Inspect:** 
  - `/src/features/events/components/tabs/BtcImportTab.js`
  - `/src/app/api/events/import-btc/route.js`
  - `btc-import.js`
  - `entity-resolution.js`

## Fix (if known or applied)
- **Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress
- **Fix Description:** Investigation needed to determine why the import is limited
- **Testing:** Will test with manual BTC import after fix is implemented

## Resolution Log
- **Commit/Branch:** `issue/1023-btc-import-limited-events`
- **PR:** TBD
- **Deployed To:** Not yet deployed
- **Verified By:** TBD
