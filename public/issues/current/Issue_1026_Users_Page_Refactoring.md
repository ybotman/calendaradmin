# Issue: Users Page Refactoring

## Overview
The User Management page (`src/app/dashboard/users/page.js`) is excessively large (1,349 lines) and contains a mixture of UI components, business logic, and API calls. This makes it difficult to maintain, test, and extend. The page needs refactoring to follow best practices for React component architecture, hooks, and API client usage.

## Details
- **Reported On:** 2025-04-27
- **Reported By:** Toby Balsley
- **Environment:** All environments
- **Component/Page/API Affected:** User Management page (`/src/app/dashboard/users/page.js`)
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Large monolithic component (1,349 lines)
  - Mixed concerns (UI, state management, API calls)
  - Inconsistent API access patterns (mix of direct axios calls and api-client.js)
  - Duplicated logic for data processing
  - Complex state management

## Technical Analysis

### Current Issues
1. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The `users/page.js` file is 1,349 lines long, making it difficult to understand and maintain
   - Contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated

2. **Inconsistent API Access**:
   - Some API calls use the centralized API client
   - Others make direct axios calls to the backend or local Next.js API routes
   - This inconsistency makes it harder to implement global error handling and caching

3. **Mixed UI and Logic**:
   - UI rendering, data fetching, and business logic are tightly coupled
   - Error handling is scattered throughout the component

4. **Complex State Management**:
   - Multiple useState hooks managing related state
   - Complex state updates with many dependencies
   - No clear separation between UI state and data state

5. **Limited Code Reuse**:
   - Functionality that could be reused is embedded directly in the component
   - Difficult to test or reuse parts of the implementation

### Proposed Refactoring

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Break down the page into smaller, focused components
   - Create a component hierarchy with clear responsibilities
   - Implement container/presentation pattern where appropriate

2. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Extract data fetching and business logic into custom hooks
   - Create dedicated hooks for user data, filtering, and pagination
   - Implement context providers where appropriate for shared state

3. **API Client Standardization**:
   - Consistently use the centralized API client for all backend calls
   - Extend the API client to cover all required endpoints
   - Add proper error handling and response normalization

4. **State Management**:
   - Reorganize state into logical groupings
   - Consider using useReducer for complex state interactions
   - Implement optimistic updates for better UX during edits

5. **Code Organization**:
   - Create a consistent folder structure for components, hooks, and utilities
   - Implement barrel exports (index.js files) for better imports
   - Add proper JSDoc comments for better maintainability

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- Create a component hierarchy diagram
- Identify all state and data flow requirements
- Define interface contracts between components
- Create a refactoring plan with clear milestones

### Phase 2: API Client Enhancement
- Update api-client.js to support all required user operations
- Implement consistent error handling and response formatting
- Add optional caching for frequently accessed data
- Create comprehensive tests for the API client

### Phase 3: Custom Hooks Development
- Implement useUsers hook for user data management
- Create useUserFilters hook for search and filtering
- Develop usePagination hook for DataGrid integration
- Add useUserForm hook for form handling

### Phase 4: Component Refactoring
- Create basic component structure
- Split page into logical container components
- Develop presentation components with clear props interfaces
- Implement responsive UI improvements

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- Connect all components using the new hooks
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add loading states and error boundaries
- Ensure 100% feature parity with current implementation

## Expected Benefits
- Improved maintainability through smaller, focused components
- Better testability with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced performance through optimized rendering
- Easier feature additions in the future
- Consistent patterns that can be applied to other areas of the application

## Fix (if known or applied)
- **Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress
- **Fix Description:** 
  1. Analyze the current implementation and create a refactoring plan
  2. Enhance the API client to support all required operations
  3. Extract business logic into custom hooks
  4. Break down the page into smaller components
  5. Ensure consistent patterns and approach

# SNR after interactions
ðŸ”· S â€” Created a new issue for refactoring the oversized User Management page (1,349 lines) to follow best practices. The current page mixes UI components, business logic, and API calls in a way that's difficult to maintain. The refactoring will split it into smaller components, extract logic into custom hooks, standardize API client usage, and improve state management.

ðŸŸ¡ N â€” Next steps:
1. Create a branch for this issue following naming conventions
2. Analyze the current implementation to create a component hierarchy
3. Define interface contracts between components
4. Start implementing the refactoring in phases, beginning with API client enhancements

ðŸŸ© R â€” Request Architect role to design the component hierarchy and interface contracts for the refactored User Management page. This will require analyzing the current implementation, identifying all required functionality, and designing a clean architecture that separates concerns appropriately.
