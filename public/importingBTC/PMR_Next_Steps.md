## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 (Design and Mapping)**: COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 (Test Import)**: COMPLETED
  - ‚úÖ Dry-run testing: COMPLETED (100% entity resolution success)
  - ‚úÖ Authentication issue: RESOLVED
  - ‚úÖ Category validation issue: RESOLVED
  - ‚úÖ Geolocation issue: RESOLVED
  - ‚úÖ Actual import execution: COMPLETED (100% success rate)
- üöß **Phase 3 (Historical Data)**: IN PROGRESS
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4 (Daily Import)**: PENDING
- ‚è≥ **Phase 5 (Production)**: PENDING

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Resolve Authentication Issues
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Fixed authentication token issues for TangoTiempo API access
- **Implementation**:
  - Obtained valid Firebase authentication token from TangoTiempo browser session
  - Verified token works with API requests:
    ```bash
    AUTH_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiI..." node scripts/btc-import/test-authentication.js
    ```
  - Successfully used AUTH_TOKEN environment variable with import script
- **Success Criteria**:
  - ‚úÖ API requests with token returned 200 OK status
  - ‚úÖ Token had appropriate permissions for protected endpoints
- **Completed**: 2025-04-24

### 2. Fix Category Validation Issues
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Fixed validation errors with category IDs
- **Issue Details**: 
  - The import was using mock category IDs like "mock-category-0rjxjo2" 
  - MongoDB validation fails because these aren't valid ObjectIDs
  - Error: "Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"mock-category-0rjxjo2\""
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed mock category ID generation
  - Implemented fallback to "Unknown" category with valid ObjectID
  - Modified entity-resolution.js to use proper category resolution
- **Success Criteria**:
  - ‚úÖ Category mapping uses valid MongoDB ObjectIDs
  - ‚úÖ No validation errors when creating events
- **Completed**: 2025-04-24

### 3. Fix Geolocation Format Issues
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Fixed server errors related to city geolocation format
- **Issue Details**: 
  - MongoDB geolocation validation was failing with error: "Point must be an array or object, instead got type missing"
  - Venue geolocation formatting was initially corrected but didn't solve the issue
  - Root cause identified: Venues in database were missing actual geolocation data
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated venues in database with default Boston area coordinates
  - Ensured proper GeoJSON format: `{ type: "Point", coordinates: [longitude, latitude] }`
  - Added explicit mapping of masteredCityGeolocation in event objects
  - Fixed at the database level to ensure proper data flow
- **Key Insight**:
  - The issue wasn't with our code but with missing data in the venue collection
  - Properly formatted geolocation data needs to exist in both venue and city objects
- **Success Criteria**:
  - ‚úÖ Geolocation data properly formatted and accepted by API
  - ‚úÖ No server errors (500) when creating events
- **Completed**: 2025-04-24

### 4. Re-Execute Actual (Non-Dry-Run) Import
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Run the BTC import script with fixed venue data and authentication
- **Implementation**:
  ```bash
  # Execute the script with actual data creation and authentication
  AUTH_TOKEN=your_token node scripts/btc-import/run-actual-import.js --confirm
  ```
- **Results**:
  - Import completed successfully in 12.27 seconds
  - 4 BTC events processed
  - 4 TT events created (100% success rate)
  - 100% entity resolution success rate
  - 100% validation success rate
  - All events successfully created in TangoTiempo database
  - Some non-critical warnings related to category resolution, but no blocking issues
- **Success Criteria**:
  - ‚úÖ Events successfully created in TangoTiempo database
  - ‚úÖ Entity relationships correctly established
  - ‚úÖ Geographic hierarchies properly populated
  - ‚è≥ Events display correctly in UI (pending verification)
- **Completed**: 2025-04-24

### 5. Verify Import Results
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Description**: Thoroughly verify the imported events in TangoTiempo database and UI
- **Implementation**:
  - Check TangoTiempo admin UI for newly imported events
  - Verify entity relationships (venues, organizers, categories)
  - Test event filtering and display in frontend
  - Compare imported data with source BTC data
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All events appear correctly in UI
  - Entity relationships are accurate
  - Geographic hierarchies are correct
  - No data anomalies or inconsistencies
- **Timeline**: Immediately following successful import

### 5. Update Documentation with Final Results
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Description**: Document the results of the successful import execution
- **Implementation**:
  - Update PMR_BTC_EVENT_Import.md with final import status
  - Create detailed report of import metrics and outcomes
  - Document any issues encountered and their resolutions
  - Mark Phase 2 as complete if successful
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Comprehensive documentation of actual import results
  - Clear status updates for Phase 2 completion
  - Documented lessons learned and best practices
- **Timeline**: Within 1 day of successful import completion

## Phase 3 Planning: Historical Data Cleanup

### 1. Define Historical Data Strategy
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Description**: Develop strategy for handling legacy events in TangoTiempo
- **Key Questions**:
  - How far back should we retain historical events?
  - Should we delete all events prior to import or preserve some?
  - How to handle recurring events that span the cutover period?
- **Implementation**:
  - Define cutoff date for historical data (e.g., current month start)
  - Document data retention policy
  - Create backup strategy for historical data
- **Timeline**: Begin planning after successful actual import

### 2. Develop Historical Data Cleanup Script
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Description**: Create script to implement the historical data strategy
- **Implementation**:
  - Develop script to identify events for cleanup
  - Implement backup mechanism before deletion
  - Add logging and reporting for cleanup operations
  - Include dry-run capability for testing
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Script correctly identifies events based on strategy
  - Backup functionality works as expected
  - Logging provides clear audit trail
  - Dry-run mode for safe testing
- **Timeline**: After strategy definition

## Authentication Approach

### Current Issues
- The import script is encountering 401 (Unauthorized) errors when attempting to create events
- Error message: "No token provided"
- All other aspects of the import process are working successfully (entity resolution, validation)

### Authentication Solution Options

#### Option 1: Environment Variable
```bash
# Set token as environment variable
export AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
# Run script using environment variable
node scripts/btc-import/run-actual-import.js
```

#### Option 2: Authentication File
```javascript
// Create auth.json file with token
{
  "token": "your_token_here",
  "expires": "2025-12-31"
}

// Update import script to read from file
const authConfig = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('auth.json', 'utf8'));
const token = authConfig.token;
```

#### Option 3: Login Flow Integration
- Implement a programmatic login flow that obtains a token
- Store token securely for the duration of the import process
- Refresh token if needed during long-running imports

### Recommendation
Option 1 (Environment Variable) is recommended for simplicity and security:
- No tokens stored in code or files
- Compatible with CI/CD pipelines
- Follows standard security practices
- Simplest to implement

## Success Metrics

The following metrics will be used to evaluate success across all phases:

1. **Entity Resolution Rate**: Target ‚â• 90% (Current: 100%)
2. **Validation Rate**: Target ‚â• 95% (Current: 100%)
3. **Overall Success Rate**: Target ‚â• 85% (Current: 100%)
4. **Data Accuracy**: Imported events match source data
5. **Performance**: Import process completes within acceptable timeframe
6. **Reliability**: Daily imports run successfully with minimal manual intervention

## Technical Learnings

1. **Authentication**: 
   - Firebase authentication token is required for API access
   - Token can be extracted from browser requests to TangoTiempo UI
   - Environment variable `AUTH_TOKEN` is the safest way to pass the token

2. **Entity Resolution**:
   - Category resolution requires real MongoDB ObjectIDs
   - Fallback to "Unknown" category handles unmatched categories
   - Venue resolution works correctly with fallback to "NotFound" venue
   - Organizer resolution works correctly with fallback to "DEFAULT" organizer

3. **Geolocation Requirements**:
   - Venue coordinates must be in GeoJSON format `{ type: "Point", coordinates: [longitude, latitude] }`
   - Venue database records must contain valid geolocation data
   - Events require both venue and city geolocation data to be properly formatted
   - Default Boston coordinates can be used as fallback when precise coordinates are unavailable
