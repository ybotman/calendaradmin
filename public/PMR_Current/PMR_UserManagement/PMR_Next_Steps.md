# PMR_UserManagement: Next Steps

## Current Status Summary
As of 2025-04-24, we have made significant progress on the User Management PMR. Specifically:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Fixed role display to properly show concatenated roleNameCode values
- Removed "Create Org" column option per requirements
- Updated status fields to show isApproved and isEnabled from localUserInfo
- Documented detailed analysis of role display issue and solution

üöß **In Progress:**
- Restoring UI elements from lost commit (Phase 1)
- Fixing data refresh issues when switching between tabs (Phase 2)
- Reviewing API pagination implementation (Phase 2)
- Removing temporary users tab and associated UI elements (Phase 3)

‚è≥ **Pending:**
- Implementing proper caching strategy for user data (Phase 2)
- Adding comprehensive error handling for failed data fetches (Phase 2)
- Completing removal of all temp user code (Phase 3)
- Final testing and validation (Phase 5)

## Recommended Next Actions

### 1. Complete Phase 1: User Interface Redesign
The primary focus should be to complete the UI redesign by restoring the elements from the lost commit. This includes:

- Identifying the specific UI elements that were lost in the previous commit
- Restoring those elements while maintaining the current fixes
- Ensuring the UI is consistent across all user management screens

### 2. Address Phase 2: Tab Navigation and Data Loading
After completing Phase 1, focus on fixing the data inconsistency issues:

- Implement a solution for the data refresh issue when switching between tabs
- Fix the API pagination implementation to ensure consistent loading
- Develop a proper caching strategy to improve performance and data consistency
- Add comprehensive error handling for all API interactions

### 3. Complete Phase 3: Temporary Users Removal
Once Phases 1 and 2 are complete, proceed with removing all temporary user functionality:

- Remove the Temp Users tab from the UI
- Remove all code related to temporary users
- Update tab navigation to handle the removed tab
- Ensure all remaining tabs function correctly

## Technical Considerations

### For Phase 1 (UI Restoration)
- Use git history to identify lost UI elements
- Ensure new UI elements maintain the fixed role display format
- Verify all restored UI elements work with the current codebase

### For Phase 2 (Data Loading)
- Consider implementing React Query or a similar solution for data fetching and caching
- Use the 'rolesToUse' pattern established in the role display fix to avoid closure issues
- Ensure tab state is properly managed to prevent data inconsistency

### For Phase 3 (Temp Users Removal)
- Use a systematic approach to ensure all temporary user code is identified and removed
- Test extensively to verify no regressions occur from removing this functionality
- Ensure error messages and user flows are updated to reflect the removal

## Timeline
- Phase 1 Completion: 2025-04-25
- Phase 2 Completion: 2025-04-28
- Phase 3 Completion: 2025-04-30
- Final Testing: 2025-05-01
- Deployment: 2025-05-02

## Dependencies
- Backend API must remain stable during this work
- Role structure in the database should not change
- MongoDB connections must be reliable

## Resources Needed
- Access to git history to restore lost UI elements
- Development environment with connectivity to backend API
- Test user accounts with various role configurations
