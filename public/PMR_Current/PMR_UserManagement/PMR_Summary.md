# PMR_UserManagement - Executive Summary

## Overview

The User Management PMR aims to improve the user management functionality in the CalOps administration application, focusing on data presentation, performance, and usability. This PMR addresses several key issues with the current implementation, including inconsistent role displays, redundant UI options, and data loading problems.

## Current Status

As of 2025-04-24:
- **Phase 0 (Analysis)**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 1 (User Interface Updates)**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 2 (Tab Navigation and Data Loading)**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 3 (Temporary Users Removal)**: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 4 (Data Consistency and Error Handling)**: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 5 (Firebase Integration)**: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Role Display**: Implemented concatenated roleNameCode display to improve readability and consistency.
2. **Enhanced UI Elements**: Removed unnecessary UI elements like the "Create Org" button and improved status fields.
3. **Improved Tab Navigation**: Fixed data inconsistency when switching between tabs with a centralized filtering approach.
4. **Added Pagination**: Implemented proper pagination with state preservation for better navigation.
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures.
6. **Introduced Simplified User Edit Form**: Added a more user-friendly form for editing user permissions.

## Next Steps

Current focus is on Phase 3: removing temporary user functionality from the system. This includes:
- Removing the Temp Users tab from the UI
- Eliminating temporary user filtering logic and related handlers
- Updating the user creation flow to no longer create temporary users
