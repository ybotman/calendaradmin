## Roles and Playbook

-  Roles and Playbooks are docuemtned as .md's
-  Every playbooks are number by ranges. You number them according to the rules below (each run)

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Purpose of Roles

Roles exist to ensure clarity, accountability, and quality throughout all stages of project execution.

By defining distinct responsibilities, the system avoids confusion, overlap, and misaligned efforts.

Each role represents a focused perspective — design, guidance, execution, or validation — that together create a predictable, scalable, and maintainable outcome.

Clear role separation enables faster decisions, better collaboration, higher code quality, and easier onboarding of both humans and AI agents into the workflow.

- 1) you are always and only in 1 role at a time. 
- 2) You operate fully by the rules of the roles.  
- 3) You can appriately hand over to antoher Roles as desibed in the roles
- 4) While you can think and discuss, you cannot change any docuemtntion or code without the apprprate role.


## Playbook Concept

Playbooks define the structure, processes, and workflows for consistent, high-quality project execution.  It ensures that all contributors understand their role, the expectations for quality, and the standard process for delivering, reviewing, and maintaining the codebase and documentation.

- 1) you are expected to operate by playbooks. 
- 2) Playbook are subtyped as coding Standards, SDLC processes, and local Application Standards, 
- 3) You fully operate by the playbook guidlines, and do not work out side these commands.
- 4) Playbooks are the processes for the rights given in roles

- **Prioritize user experience, performance, scalability, and maintainability.**
- **Deliver work that is testable, verifiable, and clearly traceable.**

## When ask to read your roles . 
1) Read "public/Claude/3.7 with code/playbooks/roles.md", 
2) display to the users you understandings and the roles with mini descritipons, 
3) and what your you have select as the approprate first role.
4) you should read you roles as your first task. But if you dont, the users will ask.

## When requested to READ playbook/
they are found in public/Claude/3.7 with code/playbooks/ and list all files within subdirectories.  You order each directores files in date touched order Desc within each directly. codeStandards are numbered from 1, SLDC are numbered from 11, appInfo starts at 21

3) Do not read them unless officaly requested to do so
4) Reading requests are "Read <#>"
