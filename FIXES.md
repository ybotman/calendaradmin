# MUI Integration Fixes for Next.js

When setting up the project, we encountered an issue with MUI integration in Next.js. The error was:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@mui/material-nextjs/v14-appRouter'
```

## Fixes Applied

1. **Removed dependency on `@mui/material-nextjs`**:
   - This package wasn't correctly compatible with our Next.js version

2. **Created a custom `ThemeRegistry` component**:
   - Implemented the official emotion cache approach from the MUI Next.js examples
   - This properly handles server-side rendering of MUI styles

3. **Updated Next.js version**:
   - Changed from 14.2.11 to 14.1.0 for better compatibility
   - This version is tested and known to work well with our MUI setup

4. **Simplified layout component**:
   - Removed explicit references to `ThemeProvider` and `CssBaseline` from the root layout
   - Encapsulated all MUI theming in the `ThemeRegistry` component

## Result

These changes ensure proper server-side rendering of Material UI components in our Next.js app, avoiding hydration mismatches and style flickering during page loads.

If you encounter any MUI styling issues, check:
1. The `ThemeRegistry.js` component implementation
2. The root layout's wrapping of the application with the ThemeRegistry
3. The MUI and emotion package versions in package.json
