# Geo-Location Architecture in TangoTiempo

## 1. Vision - The Ideal User Experience

### For Regular Users
- Users should be automatically placed in their local region/city based on their physical location (IP address)
- Users can manually override this geo-detection and select any region/division/city to view events there
- Location selection persists across sessions for returning users
- Users can set favorite locations for quick access

### For Regional Organizers
- Regional Organizers should have permission to create events only in their assigned regions/cities
- Their geo-location determines what venues they can select for events
- They should be able to view a list of their authorized regions/divisions/cities
- The UI should clearly show their current geo-context when creating events

### Filtering and Navigation
- Events should be filterable by a hierarchical location structure: Region → Division → City
- Users should be able to explore neighboring regions easily
- Distance-based search should be available (e.g., "show events within 50 miles")
- Geographic context should be clear in the UI at all times

## 2. Current Implementation - Technical Architecture

### Data Models (Backend)

#### Hierarchical Location Model

Country → Region → Division → City


## 3. Gaps Between Vision and Current Implementation

### Technical Gaps

1. **Parallel Context Systems**: The application uses both `RegionsContext` and `MasteredLocationContext` which causes confusion and potential inconsistencies. These two systems don't always stay in sync.

2. **Incomplete Migration to Mastered Locations**: The event schema still has a required `regionName` field alongside the newer optional `masteredRegionName`, `masteredDivisionName`, and `masteredCityName` fields.

3. **Inconsistent State Management**: The location state is fragmented across multiple contexts and components rather than having a single source of truth.

4. **User Authorization Gaps**: There is no clear system to link a RegionalOrganizer's permissions to specific regions/cities in the current implementation.

5. **Inefficient Data Loading**: The hierarchical data is often loaded sequentially rather than in a more efficient manner.

6. **Missing Persistence**: User location preferences aren't persistently stored between sessions.

### User Experience Gaps

1. **Unclear Location Context**: The UI doesn't consistently communicate which region/division/city the user is currently viewing.

2. **No Distance-Based Search**: While the backend supports geospatial queries, the frontend doesn't offer a distance-based search option.

3. **Missing Regional Organizer UI**: The UI doesn't clearly indicate to Regional Organizers which regions they have permission to create events in.

4. **No Favorites System**: Users can't save their favorite locations for quick access.

5. **Inconsistent Navigation**: The region selection flow is separate from the rest of the UI rather than being integrated.

6. **Limited Default Location Logic**: The system defaults to Boston when geolocation fails instead of using a more nuanced approach.

## 4. Recommendations

### Technical Recommendations

1. **Unified Location Context**:
   ```javascript
   // Create a single comprehensive location context
   export const GeoLocationProvider = ({ children }) => {
     const [locationHierarchy, setLocationHierarchy] = useState({
       country: { id: null, name: null },
       region: { id: null, name: null },
       division: { id: null, name: null },
       city: { id: null, name: null, coordinates: null }
     });
     const [userCoordinates, setUserCoordinates] = useState(null);
     const [userPermissions, setUserPermissions] = useState({
       allowedRegions: [],
       allowedCities: [],
       maxDistance: null
     });
     
     // Methods to update the hierarchy while maintaining consistency
     // Geolocation detection with better fallbacks
     // Permission checking methods
     
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Complete the Data Model Migration**:
   - Make the mastered location fields required in the Event schema
   - Add a data migration script to populate any missing fields
   - Deprecate the legacy `regionName` field

3. **Implement Proper User-Region Authorization**:
   - Add a direct relationship between UserLogin and allowed regions/cities
   - Create an API endpoint to fetch a user's allowed locations
   - Add permission checking to event creation/editing

4. **Optimize Data Loading**:
   - Implement a combined API endpoint that returns the full hierarchy in one request
   - Use caching for frequently accessed location data
   - Implement lazy loading for deeper parts of the hierarchy

5. **Add Location Persistence**:
   - Store user's location preferences in localStorage or in the database
   - Implement a user preferences API for authenticated users

### User Experience Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Location UI**:
   - Add a persistent location breadcrumb showing the current Region → Division → City
   - Highlight the current location in the site header
   - Add a map visualization for spatial context

2. **Regional Organizer Experience**:
   - Add a "My Regions" section in the user dashboard
   - Clearly indicate which regions the user can create events in
   - Show a warning when trying to create events outside permitted regions

3. **Implement Distance-Based Search**:
   - Add UI controls for "Events within X miles of me"
   - Allow users to search around any point, not just their current location
   - Add radius visualization on a map

4. **Favorites System**:
   - Allow users to star/favorite regions and cities
   - Implement a quick-access dropdown for favorite locations
   - Add a "Remember my location" toggle

5. **Integrated Navigation**:
   - Redesign the region selector to be more integrated with the main UI
   - Add a hierarchical breadcrumb navigation
   - Use a map-based selector as an alternative navigation method

6. **Smarter Defaults**:
   - Implement a more sophisticated fallback system (user's last location → popular regions → default)
   - Add a "popular regions" quick-access section
   - Use browser geolocation API as a backup to IP geolocation

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Consolidate the Architecture**
   - Merge the two context systems into a unified GeoLocationContext
   - Complete the data model migration
   - Fix inconsistencies in the existing code

2. **Phase 2: Improve the User Experience**
   - Enhance the location UI and navigation
   - Add clear location indicators throughout the application
   - Implement location persistence

3. **Phase 3: Add Advanced Features**
   - Implement distance-based search
   - Add the favorites system
   - Enhance the regional organizer experience

4. **Phase 4: Optimize Performance**
   - Implement caching and data optimization
   - Add prefetching for commonly accessed data
   - Improve loading states and transitions

By following these recommendations, the TangoTiempo application can achieve a more cohesive, intuitive, and powerful geo-location system that better serves both regular users and regional organizers.
